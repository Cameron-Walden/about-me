                <p id = "bio">Hi I'm Cameron! I live in Seattle, Washington with my partner and dog, Donte! Originally I went to school for music. More specifically, MIDI production and audio engineering. I worked at a music venue for awhile, but decided late nights behind an audio board weren't for me. More recently I worked at Stumptown Coffee Roasters here in Seattle for about 4 years. I love reading books and graphic novels! The Sandman by Neil Gaiman is one of my all time favorites. I enjoy playing my synths and keyboards and also love watching basketball. I'm a huge Milwuakee Bucks fan and was lucky enough to be able to go to game 3 of the Finals this year. It was our first home game in 50 years and we won. I've enjoyed my time at Code Fellows so far and am looking forward to what the future has in store for me. Once I graduate I hope to find a job that will continue to push me and that I also enjoy! </p>
