                <p id = "bio">Hi I'm Cameron! I live in Seattle, Washington with my partner and dog, Donte! Originally I went to school for music. More specifically, MIDI production and audio engineering. I worked at a music venue for awhile, but decided late nights behind an audio board weren't for me. More recently I worked at Stumptown Coffee Roasters here in Seattle for about 4 years. I love reading books and graphic Novels! The Sandman by Neil Gaiman is one of my all time favorites. I also enjoy watching basketbal( Go Bucks!) and playing my synths and keyboards. </p>
